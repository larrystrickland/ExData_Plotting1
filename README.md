## Assignment 1

This repo contains the .R files and .png results for assignemt 1.

All .R files assume that the file household_power_consumption.txt is in the working directory.

Note: the plots do appear a little differnt to those in the assigement.  This is because those shown for the assignment are 504x504 pixels, yet we were instructed to provide 480x480 pixel png files!
